# UFOs

## Overview
The purpose of the analysis is to provide a more in-depth analysis of UFO sightings by allowing users to filter for multiple criteria at the same time.

The project will display the the raw data in table format, making it easy to analyze the records.

## Results
The table allows user to filter the results based on their choices. The website allows user to enter their desired value and the table is filtered when the user presses enter after completing the choice. There is no filter button, that the uses has to press.

The website also allows the user to filter on multiple choices. As the user goes on entering the values in multiple fields, the table is filtered accordingly to display only the results that match the filter(s).

Let's look at an example.

The user opens the website, and sees the complete list of all sightings.

The user decides that he wants to see the details for all California UFO sightings. So they enter ca in the state text field. The table filters on ca and displays only sightings for California.

Since there are so many for CA, the users decides that they want see the sightings just for their their home town - San Diego. So, they enter the value in city text field and press enter. The table further filters on city value showing results for San Diego.

Now, let's say the user wants to see how many UFO sightings for a particular shape - triangle. The list further filters down to display only triangle sightings in San Diego, California.

## Summary

The website is pretty good in informing the users about the details for various UFO sightings over the years. Since it also allows the user to filter records, the user can easily find the info that they are looking for without getting lost.

However, one drawback of the website is that a lot of the data is focused on California and not the rest of the country. So, it is possible to ignore this as some "hippes" in California are imaging things, If the data however was from across the country, it would have been difficult to ignore the website and underlying data.

Two ways in which the website can be improved upon:

- More images. Nothing captures the imagination of reader as images/pictures. All the data in comments is good, but if there were images to back up what the comments said, there would have been a greater impact on readers/users.
- There should be another filter to narrow down the results based on comments. So, let's say a user wants to search how many 'UFOs' were sighted. There is nothing in the website that shows this right now.
